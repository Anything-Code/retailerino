# Backend for retailerino

This repo contains the setup and access to the db-structure as well as seeders for the backend of the student-project retailerino. The API uses the GraphQL query language and mainly uses the following packages to achieve that:

- nexus
- express
- express-sesssion
- apollo-server-express
- primsa
- nexus-prisma
- nexus-shield

Typescript and immutable.js are used to program in a declarative manner.

Authentication uses express-session with http-only cookies.
